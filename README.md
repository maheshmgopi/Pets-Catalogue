# Pets Catalogue

This is a solution provided for the AGL test.

#### Features
  - The list of pets is filtered for cats, grouped according to the gender of the owner and sorted alphabetically by the name of the pet
  - 7 Test cases have been identified and implemented.
  - The test cases can be run by opening the test.html file in a web browser.
  - The test cases are mentioned in the petsCatalogue.specs.js file.


#### Tech
  - JavaScript

#### Libraries
-  jasmine.js, jasmine-html.js, boot.js and jasmine.css (Testing)

The solution built only with JavaScript. The advanced and latest featres of JavaScript are used. For eg; the `fetch` api is available only in latest browsers. The `XMLHttpRequest` could have been used instead. But I prefer to use the latest features. 

#### Run
- Clone the project or download the project as zip file.
- Open the index.html in a web browser

If the application runs into cross-domain issue, 
- disable web security in chrome, if chrome is used.
- Select "Disable Local File Restrictions" under Ssafari's Develop preferences, if Safari is used.
